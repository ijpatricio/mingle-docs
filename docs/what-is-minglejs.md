# What is MingleJS?

As you may already know, [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/) is a full-stack framework for [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) that allows you to build dynamic interfaces using server-side code.
MingleJS allows you to use React/Vue components in your Livewire application, so you can use the best of both worlds.

## How is it working?

MingleJS renders a `div` on the server-side, and then mounts the React/Vue component on the client-side. Each JS component is rendered by a Livewire compoenent, so you get an island of interactivity in your Livewire application, with the JS of your taste.

## Some included nicety features

In the backend component, you can pass data that the component will have access to on the frontend.

You can choose to keep using Ajax client - Axios/Fetch/etc.
But the reality is, for the most part, you can use the convenient way of making server actions, which is Livewire. You get to make server requests just by `$wire.addTodo(todo)`. Find below a simple diagram of how MingleJS works in a page.

## How do I use it?

All you have to do is a regular Livewire component, with a little twist, so it can render JavaScript.
Most likely you will pair Livewire with just one taste of JS framework, but you can mix and match as you wish.

Don't worry, there's a friendly command to create components for you.
